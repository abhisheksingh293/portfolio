# Hi, I'm Abhishek 👋

Welcome to my personal portfolio!
This site is my digital playground where I share my projects, skills, and a bit about my journey as a developer.

## 🚀 About This Project

I built this portfolio to showcase my work, experiment with new tech, and make it easy for people to get in touch.
It’s built with [React 19](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
I’m always learning and adding new things—so check back for updates!
